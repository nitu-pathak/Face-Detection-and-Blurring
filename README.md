# Face-Detection-and-Blurring

The code detects faces in the images using Haar Cascade Classifier for frontal face detection with openCV.
The detected faces are then blurred using the blur function of cv2.
The CascadeClassifier has many parameters like scaleFactor, minNeighbors, minSize, maxSize. The parameter tuning was done to obtain
the best results.
Also, the results as saved as image.
